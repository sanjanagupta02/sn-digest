A daily supernova paper reader that pulls the latest arXiv submissions and explains them in plain English using AI.

Built for researchers (especially newcomers) who want to stay on top of the supernova literature.

## What it does

- **Fetches** the latest supernova papers from arXiv every time you open it
- **Filters** by a curated keyword list (supernova, core-collapse, Ic-BL, SLSN, GRB-SN, and more)
- **Tracks** which papers you've already seen — new ones are highlighted, old ones dimmed
- **Explains** each paper in plain English using Claude (Anthropic) or Gemini Flash (Google)
- **Exports** any paper + its AI analysis as a Markdown file, ready to paste into Obsidian, Notion, or any notes app

No installation or backend needed.
